# Create a Server

After signing up, the first step to launching your WordPress site is creating a server. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Server

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard
Once you log in to your WPOven account first time, you'll be directed to the **Servers** tab. Here, you can manage all your servers, but to start it will ask you to create a server.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Servers Section
1. If you did not get redirected to **Servers** tab , Click on the **Servers** tab in the top menu.
2. On the Servers page, click the **Create Server** button.

### Step 3: Choose Your Server Configuration
You'll be prompted to configure your new server. Follow these steps:

1. **Select Server Name**: Select a user friendly name for your server.
2. **Choose a Plan**: Pick a plan based on your site's requirements, such as traffic, storage, and performance needs. Start with professional if not sure , it gives a good perfoamnce. 
3. **Select Region**: Choose a server location closest to your target audience for optimal performance , though we recommend using Cloudflare in front of your site for optimal performance.
4. **Payment Menthod**: Currently two payment methods are availbile Paypal and Stripe , either will support credit cards / wallets . We recommend choosing what you are comfortable with. 

### Step 4: Finalize and Create
Click the **Create Server** button to start the provisioning process. This may take a few minutes ( normally 10 - 15 minutes ) as WPOven sets up your server and optimizes it for WordPress hosting.

### Step 5: Monitor Server Setup
Once the process begins, you can monitor the setup progress in the **Servers** section. When it's ready, the server status will change to "Active."
